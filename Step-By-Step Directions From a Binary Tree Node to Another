Question
You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value 
of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.
Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase 
letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:
  -> 'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
  -> 'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
  -> 'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.

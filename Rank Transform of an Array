Question
Given an array of integers arr, replace each element with its rank.
The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:
    Rank is an integer starting from 1.
    The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
    Rank should be as small as possible.            


               
Time Complexity: O(N*(log(N))), where N is the length of the array
Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the array


Solution
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> arrayRankTransform(vector<int>& arr) {
        
        // Sorted set having one occurrence of each element of arr
        set<int> uset;
        for(auto i : arr) {
            uset.insert(i);
        }
        
        // Store the rank for each number in arr
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        int rank = 1;
        for(auto num : uset) {
            mp[num] = rank;
            rank++;
        }
        
        // Saving the rank for each number
        vector<int> ans(arr.size());
        for(int i=0; i<arr.size(); i++) {
            ans[i] = mp[arr[i]];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};

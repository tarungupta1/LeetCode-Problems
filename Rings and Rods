Question
There are n rings and each ring is either red, green, or blue. The rings are distributed across ten rods labeled from 0 to 9.
You are given a string rings of length 2n that describes the n rings that are placed onto the rods. Every two characters in rings forms a color-position pair that is 
used to describe each ring where:
  -> The first character of the ith pair denotes the ith ring's color ('R', 'G', 'B').
  -> The second character of the ith pair denotes the rod that the ith ring is placed on ('0' to '9').
  
For example, "R3G2B1" describes n == 3 rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the 
rod labeled 1.
Return the number of rods that have all three colors of rings on them.

Solution

APPROACH 1
class Solution {
public:
    int countPoints(string rings) {
        
        int n = rings.length(); 
        vector<int> v1(10, 0);
        vector<int> v2(10, 0);
        vector<int> v3(10, 0);
        
        
        for(int i=0; i<rings.length(); i+=2){
            if(rings[i] == 'R'){
                v1[rings[i+1] - '0']++;
            }
            if(rings[i] == 'G'){
                v2[rings[i+1] - '0']++;
            }
            if(rings[i] == 'B'){
                v3[rings[i+1] - '0']++;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
            if(v1[i] !=0  &&  v2[i] !=0  &&  v3[i] != 0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
 
 
 
APPROACH 2
class Solution {
public:
    int countPoints(string rings) {
        
// will use OR operator to check whether the given rod has all the colors or not. Assigning Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4; SO if all colors are present then that rod will store 7
        vector<int> count(10, 0);
        for(int i=0; i<rings.length(); i+=2){
            if(rings[i] == 'R'){
                count[rings[i+1] - '0'] |= 1; // OR operation
            }
            else if(rings[i] == 'G'){
                count[rings[i+1] - '0'] |= 2; // OR operation
            }
            else{
                count[rings[i+1] - '0'] |= 4; // OR operation
            }
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
            if(count[i] == 7){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
